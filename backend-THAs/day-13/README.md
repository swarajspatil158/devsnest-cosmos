## Waterfall Methodology
The waterfall methodology uses a sequential or linear approach to software development. The project is broken down into a sequence of tasks, with the highest level grouping referred to as phases. A true waterfall approach requires phases that are completed in sequence and have formal exit criteria, typically a sign-off by the project stakeholders. A typical list of waterfall tasks would include:

- Scope and plan project

- Gather and document requirements

- Design application


- Develop application and perform unit tests


- Conduct system testing


- Perform UAT


- Fix application as appropriate


- Deploy application

The waterfall methodology is a formal process, with each phase comprising a list of detail tasks with accompanying documentation and exit criteria. Larger enterprises often require the use of SDLC methodology products, particularly in larger IT application projects. This is also the approach that SIs use when building IT applications for their customers, since budget, resources, deliverables, and scope have to be managed on a very disciplined basis.

# What Is Agile Methodology
The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.

## Agile methodologies overview
The Agile Manifesto of Software Development put forth a groundbreaking mindset on delivering value and collaborating with customers when it was created in 2001. Agile's four main values are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
## Agile methodologies frameworks
So what is Agile methodology in project management? Itâ€™s a process for managing a project that involves constant collaboration and working in iterations. Today, the word Agile can refer to these values and the frameworks for implementing them, including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and Adaptive Project Framework (APF).
