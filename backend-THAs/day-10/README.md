  1) Configure EC2â€™s instance Inbound rules to accept traffic from server port.
  2) Install `nvm` and `node` in the instance
  3) Use Git to clone source code to the instance. In order to do that in the Linux instance, we need to:
  4) Generate `SSH` key in the instance and add it to GitHub settings
  5) Install Git and clone the repo
  6) Install appâ€™s dependencies along with PM2
  7) Run the Node.js server
